# Introduction
Repository for Open Translators to Things. Grouped by translators written for specific schemas. The schema names are uniquely namespaced.
The translator name is a unique string identifying a Thing.

This README will help get you started developing in this repo.

## Publish a Translator Package to NPM

A translator package includes one thing translator along with all the schemas
it references. Because those are not organized in the way `npm publish`
expects, the process of publishing a translator package uses a script from
the CLI repo.

1. Update the `version` property in the package.json file in the translator
directory. (Of cource any other metadata may be updated also, but a version
bump is required when publishing to npm, since you may not re-publish over an
existing version.)

2. Clone the CLI repo (or sync it as needed), and install its dependencies:

```
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/opent2t/cli
npm install
cd ../translators
```

3. Use the script to generate a package.json for the translator to be
published. Note the last parameter is a simple name of a translator,
not a directory path, which would include a schema name.

```
node ../cli/pack-translator.js com.wink.thermostat
```

4. Edit the package.json to include directories for referenced schemas in the
`files` collection at the end. Lines will include at least `"oic.core"` and
`"oic.baseresource"`; possibly others if the OCF schema .json file has `$ref`
references to others. ([Eventually the pack-translator.js script should add
these lines automatically.](https://github.com/openT2T/opent2t-cli/issues/7))

5. Ensure you're logged in to NPM under the **opent2t** account:

```
npm login
Username: opent2t
Password: *********
```

6. Publish the package to NPM:
```
npm publish
```
